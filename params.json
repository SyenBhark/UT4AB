{"name":"UI Tutorial for Android Beginners","tagline":"The UI tutorial for Android beginners who have never experienced it.","body":"### Welcome to UT4AB(UI Tutorial for Android Beginners) Pages!\r\nThis open source project is for helping Android novices out of having trouble in manipulating it. You can fork this project to make your own one for them!\r\n\r\n### Project Idea\r\nAndroid is one of the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, but there are still too many novices like the old. This project let them know essential Android manipulation by showing the simulation videos and allowing them to simulate by themselves on this application. These are much better than just describing the ways via only words. I picked up top 5 difficulties for novices based on my experience when watching the way to learn Android of the my grandma, my parents and other old people:\r\n1. The way to unlock the (basic) screen when the device screen turned off. \r\n2. The way to answer the incoming call.\r\n3. The way to run an application.\r\n4. The way to manipulate the cursor (pointer while typing).\r\n5. The way to scroll the screen.\r\n\r\n### 1. The way to unlock the (basic) screen when the device screen turned off, 2. The way to answer the incoming call, 5. The way to scroll the screen.\r\nMost of novices have no intuition of its touch UI, so this application tries to explain how to manipulate it sometimes via the simulation video and check whether they can do them, or not.\r\n\r\n### 3. The way to run an application.\r\nIn my experience, the novice used to press an application for long time, not just hit(click) it, in the first time when they want to run one. This application helps them understand their difference.\r\n\r\n### 4. The way to manipulate the cursor (pointer while typing).\r\nThis is one of the most difficult parts to use the touch UI, so this application lets beginners know what the cursor and its pointer are and shows the simulation video to manipulate it. Finally, it requires user to do that and check its answer.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
